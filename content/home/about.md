The Human Centred Computing (HCC) group is concerned with the design, development and evaluation of systems with which humans interact and engage in complex and varied ways, focusing on computer graphics, data visualisation, human-computer interaction and natural language processing. We aim to develop international expertise in empirical design, user centred methodologies, visual analytics, information visualisation, natural language processing, multi-modal interfaces, human factors, and human computer interaction.
