# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research is positioned at the intersection of Human Centred Interaction, mental health intervention, and learning sciences. I am interested in understanding how technology can meaningfully help in supporting the development of core competencies known to promote mental health---such as self-regulation, coping with stress, or conflict resolution---in real-world contexts.

My research is positioned at the intersection of Human Centred Interaction, mental health intervention, and learning sciences. I am interested in understanding how technology can meaningfully help in supporting the development of core competencies known to promote mental health---such as self-regulation, coping with stress, or conflict resolution---in real-world contexts. This research agenda is supported through collaboration with multiple partners including Oxford University, UCL, Anna Freud Centre in London, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, Harvard Medical School, and Committee for Children (a US-based non-profit developers of a social-emotional learning program used in more than 30% of US schools). We've published a series of papers at top tier HCI venues furthering this research direction over the last 4 years (with 3x CHI, 2x CSCW, 1x TOCHI as first authored), including a Best Paper awards at CHI'17 and CSCW'18. 

Currently, my main research project focuses on understanding of how novel digital objects (e.g., socially assistive robots) could lead to innovative intervention delivery approaches, which are embedded in the everyday lives of young children and their families; our specific case study focusses on the development of self-regulation competencies (UCL, UC Santa Cruz, CfC). The second core project investigates the potential of voice-assistants (such as Alexa/GoogleHome) to deliver prevention interventions in real-world settings (Oxford). I also serve as the Research Lead on two other projects: embedding conflict-resolution training into Minecraft gameplay for children aged 11-14 (UC Irvine, CfC) and a personal informatics app empowering parents of 2-5 year olds to develop positive parenting techniques (CfC); as well as supporting two projects at Oxford (digital self-control; child privacy).
