I am a Lecturer in the Department of Informatics at King's College London, an Honorary Visiting Fellow at City, University of London and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

My research focuses on improving interactions with computers and data. My work is highly user-focused and considers the development of novel interaction techniques and design approaches and to make the best use of a full range of human capability.
